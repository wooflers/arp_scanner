Whoa a help file!

Updated as of v.0.0.7
============================
So here's the tea...

This is a python project I'm making to help learn the language and play with networking. Don't take any of this too seriously :)

The scanner uses Scapy to scan via ARP broadcast. 
The scanner takes the replies ip and mac addresses and add them to a SQLite3 db with a scan ID to indentify which scan they were apart of.
There is a table of known hosts which hosts that have been scanned can be added too. This can help if you're looking for new hosts.
============================

Scanning options -

Target Network - Pretty self explanitory but this is going to be the local network that you're currently on. i.e. 192.168.0.1/24.
If you're not familiar with CIDR format... google it.

Interval - This is the number of seconds between scans. If you're scanning over a longer period of time you might not want to keep flooding brodcast messages.

Duration - How long the scan will last.

What is breaks down to is that when you have the options selected the scanner will scan [target_network] every [interval] seconds for [duration] seconds.

So if...
target_network = 192.168.0.1/24
interval = 300
duration = 3600

The scanner will scan 192.168.0.1/24 every 5 minutes for an hour.
============================

SQLite3 database stuff -

Scans and info are stored in the sqlite_netscan.db file. if it gives you trouble rebuild the tables with the options in the menu.

Not everything in here might be used yet.
